/// The number of engines TablePro offers is published in three places that cannot see each other:
/// this registry, `docs/snippets/driver-counts.mdx`, and the marketing site. Nothing at runtime
/// reconciles them, and by August 2026 they read 28, 27 and 25 at once.
///
/// The answer is 30, and the reason it read 28 for a while is worth keeping. Turso is served by
/// the libSQL plugin and was the only alias in `reverseTypeIndex` with no curated entry of its
/// own, so it was the only type the picker could not offer before its plugin was installed.
/// ScyllaDB is the shape every other alias already had: an alias of Cassandra with a curated
/// entry all the same. Turso now matches it, and the count falls out of the entries rather than being
/// asserted on top of it. Do not "correct" this back to 28 by deleting that entry.
///
/// A failure here means a driver was added or removed, which is a deliberate act. Update
/// `expectedTypeIds`, then `docs/snippets/driver-counts.mdx`, the `and N more` count in the
/// `docs/index.mdx` frontmatter, and the engine count on tablepro.app in the same change.
/// `docs/scripts/check-docs-against-source.py` reads the registry and holds the docs half.
///
/// The count is taken from the built-in defaults rather than from `allRegisteredTypeIds()`.
/// Both answer 30 under XCTest, where no plugin bundle ever loads, but the registry is a
/// process-global singleton and suites that register a synthetic type run alongside this one.
