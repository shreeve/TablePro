/// One execution's product: its rows, and the facts about how they were produced.
///
/// This is not where view state lives. A `ResultSet` is rebuilt with a fresh `id` on every table
/// load, page turn, sort and re-execute, and `TabDisplayState.replaceUnpinnedResults(with:)` drops
/// the one it replaces, so anything kept here is gone the first time the user turns a page.
/// `QueryTab` owns what has to outlive a single result: sort, pagination, column layout, chart
/// configuration and filters.
///
/// It used to mirror the first three of those, along with the tab's table name, editability and
/// metadata version. Nothing read any of them, and having them here made this look like the
/// established home for per-result view state, which is how the chart configuration nearly ended
/// up here (#2243). `origin` is the one of those facts that earns its place: it describes this
/// result rather than the tab, and the switch reads it.
